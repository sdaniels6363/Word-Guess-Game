# Word-Guess-Game - [Link](https://sdaniels6363.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/index.html)
Coding Bootcamp - Week Three

The Word Guess game was the first Javascript assignment we were given. The requirements were to create a game similar to hangman. The game required that we take user input, in the form of keystrokes, and validated if the user's input matched a letter from the random word that was selected. Being the Liverpool fan I am, it was all but certain it was going to be Liverpool themed! This being my first attempt at Javascript, I was very proud of the results of this project.
